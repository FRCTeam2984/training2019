- Your goal is to write code to control a tank drive robot using 2 joysticks
- A working project should be able to drive a robot forwards using the left joystick and turn a robot using the right joystick
- Several basic conventions MUST be followed while doing so. These can be found in [CONVENTIONS.md](https://github.com/FRCTeam2984/training2019/blob/master/CONVENTIONS.md)
- A basic [robot.py](https://github.com/FRCTeam2984/training2019/blob/master/src/robot.py) file can be found in the src folder
- The documentation for robotpy (the main library you will be using), can be found [here](https://robotpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- It is also required that you use the magicbot framework, which is detailed in the document [here](https://robotpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/frameworks/magicbot.html)
- If you are struggling then you may ask somebody else for help, but only after working at the problem for 10 minutes
